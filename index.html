<p>There are many things describe Reagan, but what most people think of is his stern demeanor. His foreign policies weren't to make friends, they were made to win while making new allies. In the Cold War, Reagan trained men in foreign countries to behave like America's special forces. This leverage brought new opportunities to end the Cold War, something Reagan jumped on. He also strongly believed in smaller government action in citizen's business. He once said "The most terrifying words in the English language are: I'm from the government and I'm here to help.". Ronald Reagan has lived and learned throughout his life, something that has given him lots of experience with today's issues. See the Past & Future Accomplishments sections for more information about Ronald Reagan's accomplishments, and how they can apply to the world today. </p>
