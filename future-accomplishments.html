<a id="header" class="anchor" href="#header" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What can Reagan accomplish if he is reelected?</h1>

<p>As mentioned in the Past Accomplishments section of this website, many of the things Reagan has accomplished in the past can realate to modern day issues. This section will describe those relations.</p>

<h1>
<a id="header-1" class="anchor" href="#header-1" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Modern Reaganomics</h1>

<p>Reagan’s policy to cut taxes will let people have more money. With more money, people will spend more money, and boost the economy.</p>

<h1>
<a id="header-1" class="anchor" href="#header-1" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Modern Foreign Policy</h1>

<p>A version of the current Missile Defense System is used for the drone strikes being used to target Al-Qaeda and ISIS hubs. This system may be put to use if the United Nations goes into Ukraine.</p>

<h1>
<a id="header-1" class="anchor" href="#header-1" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Modern Equal Rights & Rule of Law</h1>

<p>With Reagan's views on Equal Rights, he can fix some more modern problems, including, but not limited to, racial equality and gender equality.</p>

<h1>
<a id="header-1" class="anchor" href="#header-1" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Modern States Rights</h1>

<p>Modern issues today show that a big government is incapable of keeping the people happy, so making the decisions localized can help make more individual decisions, keeping people happy by handing the power over controversial issues over to the states.</p>

<h1>
<a id="header-1" class="anchor" href="#header-1" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Modern Peace through Strength</h1>

<p>North Korea has created a new missile system that is seen as a threat to many people. To Reagan, any threat to America was seen as “evil” and would be dealt with in the same way that he dealt with the Soviet Union, through strength while maintaining peace.</p>

<h1>
<a id="header-1" class="anchor" href="#header-1" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Modern Technological Advancement</h1>

<p>Now that NASA's funding has been cut by Obama, the security of America’s astronomical supplies and research has been endangered. However, Reagan is the one who would fix the mess by creating funding for NASA to ensure the safety of our supplies and research. Every day more and more is being discovered with technology that we don’t have. But, Reagan could sacrifice some money to create technology that researchers and other people need.</p>
