<a id="header" class="anchor" href="#header" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What can Reagan accomplish if he is Re-elected?</h1>

<p>As mentioned in the Past Accomplishments section of this website, many of the things Reagan has accomplished in the past can realate to modern day issues. This section will describe those relations.</p>

<h1>
<a id="header-1" class="anchor" href="#header-1" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Modern Reaganomics</h1>

<p>Reagan’s policy to cut taxes will let people have more money. With more money, people will spend more money, and boost the economy. This ties right into the deepest beleifs of Reaganomics which is Tricle down theory where the money from the rich eventually makes it to the poor. But this dosent wait for the money to trickle down it just puts more in back into the public not the rich, not the poor, but the middle. The middle class struggles to pay taxes more than any other class. the rich are set for life and the poor just stop caring. The Middle class are the heart of the economy. Tax cuts are most bennificial to them so Reaganomics just fits.</p>

<h1>
<a id="header-1" class="anchor" href="#header-1" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Modern Foreign Policy</h1>

<p>A version of the current Missile Defense System is used for the drone strikes being used to target Al-Qaeda and ISIS hubs. This system may be put to use if the United Nations goes into Ukraine.</p>

<h1>
<a id="header-1" class="anchor" href="#header-1" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Modern Equal Rights & Rule of Lawe</h1>

<p>With Reagan's views on Equal Rights, he can fix some more modern problems, including, but not limited to, racial equality and gender equality.</p>

<h1>
<a id="header-1" class="anchor" href="#header-1" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Modern States' Rights</h1>

<p>Modern issues today show that a big government is incapable of keeping the people happy, so making the decisions localized can help make more individual decisions, keeping people happy by handing the power over controversial issues over to the states.</p>

<h1>
<a id="header-1" class="anchor" href="#header-1" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Modern Peace through Strength</h1>

<p>With policies of late Amarica has been seen as weak and soft, unlike not to long ago when nobody would stand in this powerhouse's way. Nations cowered at the thought of engaging us in battle but now they act like little kids seeing how much they can push their parents. We need to stand up like a mother with a ruler and smack them back into their place. We are the alpha, we will alays beat anybody, but first we need a strong leader, Reagan.</p>

<h1>
<a id="header-1" class="anchor" href="#header-1" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Modern Technoligical Advancement</h1>

<p>NNow that NASA's funding has been cut by Obama, the security of America’s astronomical supplies and research has been endangered. However, Reagan is the one who would fix the mess by creating funding for NASA to ensure the safety of our supplies and research. Every day more and more is being discovered with technology that we don’t have. But, Reagan could sacrifice some money to create technology that researchers and other people need.</p>
